AutoWidget is a program add-on for Kodi, designed to give a more dynamic
and interesting experience to using skin widgets. 

## Steps to Install
1.  Go to the Kodi file manager.

2.  Click on "Add source".

3.  The path for the source is `https://drinfernoo.github.io/` (Give it the name "drinfernoo").

4.  Go to "Add-ons", and choose "Install from zip".

5.  a.  For AutoWidget's Stable repo, install `repository.autowidget-1.0.zip`.
    b.  For AutoWidget's Dev repo (for testing purposes **only**), install `repository.autowidget.dev-1.0.zip`.
    
6.  Return to "Add-ons", and choose "Install from repository".

7.  Choose the repository you installed (stable or dev), and install AutoWidget from Program Add-ons.

## Steps to Use
1. Open any other plugin you wish and browse to a menu item for a list you want
2. On the context menu select "Add to autowidget group".
3. Either create a new group or add to an existing group. Groups can have more than one list or "path" inside it
4. Inside your skin add a new widget
5. For your widget Select Add ons > Autowidgets > My Groups > {your group name} > {group mode}
   - Static allows you to pick just one path from with in a group
   - Cycling will periodically choose either a new random path or rotate to the next path in the group
      - the time between cycling can be set in the settings
   - Merged will create one big list from all the paths in the group
